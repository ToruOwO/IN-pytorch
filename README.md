PyTorch implementation of Interaction Networks (Battaglia et al., 2016).

*Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics*

"Reasoning about objects, relations, and physics is central to human intelligence, and
a key goal of artificial intelligence. Here we introduce the interaction network, a
model which can reason about how objects in complex systems interact, supporting
dynamical predictions, as well as inferences about the abstract properties of the
system."
